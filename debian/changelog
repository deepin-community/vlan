vlan (1.9-3.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Stéphane Graber ]
  * Now that a vlan interface can be created by a udev hook and

    make sure to properly deal with an already existing interface.

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * If VLAN is configured with higher MTU than raw device MTU, which can
    happen if VLAN is ifup'ed before raw device, then increase raw device
    MTU first so the VLAN ifup does not fail. (LP: #1224007)

    - Build with -O2 unless DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS has noopt.
  * Prepare to ship macvlan_config in the future.
  * Add support for bonding in if-pre-up and if-post-down scripts; cleanup
